I don't inherently dislike Mondays. I just don't care for this one.

## Dear Diary
It's Monday, and that's not a terrible thing. I didn't get enough sleep last
night. Persephone woke us up every 2 hours to have explode out of her butt on
the back patio.

I'm worried about her, but less worried after talking to the vet.

I don't have enough money.

I could write that every day forever. It wasn't always that way, but when I had
enough I used it until I didn't have enough.

Natalie and I finished watching the French horror series Marianne yesterday. I
found it entertaining the way they portrayed a spooky witch. I found it
intriguing the way they portrayed possession, and what the internal war looked
like.

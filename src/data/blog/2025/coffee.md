## What's New

Last week and the week before I was drinking about 10 shots of espresso a day.

Side thought: is jungo a word? I'll ask the robot.

## Robit

**"Jungo" is a Latin word**â€”specifically, the first-person singular present active indicative form of the verb *jungere*, meaning **to join, unite, bring together, clasp (hands), connect, yoke, or harness**[1][6][7][9]. It is a third conjugation verb with forms including *jungere* (infinitive), *junxi* (perfect active), and *junctus* (supine/participle).

Outside of Latin, "Jungo" also appears as a surname of possible Spanish origin, thought to derive from a word meaning "reed" or "rush"[5], and as a modern company or proper noun name in some cases[2][4]. However, as a common English word, "jungo" does not exist.

Be cautious about informal or slang usages found in sources like Urban Dictionary, which are not standard or scholarly meanings[8].

Neat. I wonder what that will look like on the blog.

Huh, so that's what it looks like (I fucked with it a little bit).


## Onwards and Upwards

Does anyone else remember the weird rat dude from The Lion, the Witch, and the
Wardrobe? He's in at least a couple of those books and I think about him more
often than is normal. I think his name is Reepacheep. He had a little sword.

I just added that little motherfuckers name to my personal dictionary.

## Therapy

We just had couples counseling for the first time with our new therapist. She
seems promising.

I think the conclusion was, "We want to learn a new way of relating to one
another that's healthy".

She's learning how to set loving boundaries.

I'm learning how to be vulnerable in small ways to meet her where she's at.

Terminal emacs crashed, but I'm back baby.

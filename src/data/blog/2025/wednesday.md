## Meeting

I'm in a staff meeting right now. Soon, I'll be presenting some information
about communication in the unit.

I have only a vague idea of what I'm talking about, and no idea why I'm talking
about it.

This should be fun.

Yay, I did it.

## Home

Billy is taking Persephone on a walk today. That's nice.

This is going on the internet. I've already put some rather private information
up, but it's going to get crazier. Why? I want to.

Everyone seemed to be okay when I got home. I'm all set up and waiting for my
next couple of meetings.

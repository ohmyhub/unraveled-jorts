I made butter today.

## Table of contents

## Dear Future Diary
Natalie and I went to a class where we learned how to make butter. We also made
some compound butter by mixing whatever ingredients we felt like. I made a
savory butter with miso, garlic, and black sesame. I also made a sweet butter
with cocoa powder, espresso powder, powdered sugar, and candied orange.

Natalie is resting now, and I was feeling bored. I decided to put the 2024 AKC
dog show on. Specifically, the hound group. It's neat.

Persephone is really leaning in to being an adolescent puppy. She's been a bit
of a terror today.

The farm didn't have any animals. It did have other puppies.

## Skipley Farm
We went to a place out in Snohomish. It has u-pick apples, grapes, quince,
pears, and flowers. At least, that's what they have at this time of year.

Also, this morning Natalie was angry with me. My brain shut down a little bit.

I think I went almost two whole weeks wanting to be alive.

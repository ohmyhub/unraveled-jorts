## AI made me do it

Hello, you lovely, captive audience.

Let's get this out of the way: tonight's story is not for the faint of heart. Laugh if you want, but also? Feel your feelings. We're all friends here. Mostly.

So, once upon a time, I put super glue in a pimp’s keyhole. (Pause while everyone processes.) No, that’s not a euphemism. But honestly, it should be. Imagine someone whispering it in your ear: “How would you like me to super glue you right in the pimp’s keyhole?” If anyone said that to me, I'd be confused, terrified, and maybe a little turned on. Just saying.

But I digress. Let’s rewind.

A young woman—let’s call her my sister, because she is—asked me for a favor. She needed her pimp gone from their shared apartment, because he wasn’t paying rent, and honestly, he’d sort of stranded her in another state with no credit card and no ID. You know, the usual. She just wanted to come home, but she couldn’t—because he had the keys. Enter yours truly.

Her big idea: change the locks while he’s out. Simple, right? Except pimps don’t exactly punch a time clock. So I spent several weekends stalking this guy, waiting for my chance. I’ll bet you thought pimps had regular 9-to-5s. News flash: they do not.

Eventually, I got fed up. Super glue. Keyhole. One squeeze. (Side note: My girlfriend knew about this and, shockingly, did not think stalking a pimp was the hottest hobby I could have taken up. When I told her about the super glue, I was so proud—“You’ll never believe what I did, I totally got this asshole”—but she just said, “You committed petty vandalism and risked getting shot.” Yeah, well, that deflated my ego pretty quick.

Some context: It’s December. My mom has terminal cancer. My girlfriend and her other boyfriend convince me, with some help from the specter of my own mortality, that this is all a bad—possibly life-threatening—idea.

Before I quit, I call the cops. I tell them everything. But here’s the wild thing: the pimp wasn’t doing anything illegal. I mean, sure, he wasn’t on the lease, and he wasn’t paying rent, but he wasn’t committing a crime by being there. I was the one technically trying to illegally evict him.

Fast forward a few weeks. I’m at work, and my phone rings. It’s the FBI. Seattle office. “Hi, we hear you’ve been talking to the police about our guy.” I’m pretty sure my soul left my body for a minute. I admit I’ve talked about him. The agent says, “Can you tell me where he is? We’re trying to nail him for sex trafficking. Oh, and also, the local cops have a warrant for his arrest—he shot someone last summer.” So now I’m an FBI informant. I didn’t want to be a narc, but when your nemesis is a murderous pimp, you do what you gotta do.

A few weeks later, my family is gathered around my mother’s hospital bed—maybe her last night—and I get another call. From the FBI. “We got him. Door’s off its hinges, he’s in custody. What do you want to do with the car?” I say, “Impound it.” He says, “You should probably let your sister know her apartment door has been kicked in and her car’s been towed.” Did I mention my sister was the woman in my story? Yeah.

So here we are: watching my mom slip away, and now I have to make a choice. I don’t tell my sister, but around midnight, she gets a call from jail. I can tell who it is, so I go in, very proud, and tell her, “I talked to the FBI. You can go home.” But she… sides with the pimp. And now I’m terrified I’m gonna get shot.

He makes bail immediately, by the way. So now I’m the one super-gluing my own keyhole, like, “Please, God, don’t let him come for me.”

And then? Smooth sailing.

Just kidding. My mom dies a week later. My girlfriend, a week after that, bites her other boyfriend and barricades herself in her apartment, and I have to explain polyamory to the Seattle Police SWAT team. But that? That’s a story for another night.

Thanks for listening.
